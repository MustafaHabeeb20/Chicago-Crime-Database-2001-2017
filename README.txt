How to run the program:

	1.) Unzip the file
	2.) Open up the project in either Jupyter notebook/ Jupyter Lab
	3.) Run all the cells from top to bottom
		a.) Some of the image charts may not show up for the first time, so run all the cells 
		    and refresh the kernel and run the cells again
		b.) NOTE: you may need other packages to be installed. Here are some that we used:
			i.) conda install -c conda-forge folium
	
Any changes made to the dataset are spoken about in our report.
